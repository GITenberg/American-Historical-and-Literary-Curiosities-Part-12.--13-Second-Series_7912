<h2>                    AMUSING SCENES OF THE REVOLUTION.</h2>
<br>
<h3>                         JOURNAL OF A YOUNG LADY,</h3>
<br>
<h4>           Kept for the amusement of her Friend Deborah Norris,<br>
    afterwards the wife of Dr. George Logan, of Stenton, Pennsylvania.</h4></center>
<br>
<p>
UNDER the impression that the British army would very soon take
possession of Philadelphia, one of its highly respectable citizens
removed his family to North Wales, in the county of Montgomery,
Pennsylvania, and the following lively, amusing, and natural journal was
written by his daughter, then in her fifteenth year.  It was addressed to
her friend and schoolmate, Deborah Norris, subsequently married to Doctor
George Logan, the grandson of James Logan, and has been kindly loaned by
the family of the writer.</p>

<p>To the youth of the writer must be ascribed any inaccuracies of
expression which may be discovered.  It has been carefully copied from
the much-faded original, and the punctuation only corrected.  The Journal
gives a peep at the manners of the day, and introduces us to the American
army in a most characteristic manner.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>                            To DEBORAH NORRIS.</p>

<p>                                  1776-7</p>

<p>Though I have not the least shadow of an opportunity to send a letter if
I do write, I will keep a sort of journal of the time that may expire
before I see thee: the perusal of it may some time hence give pleasure in
a solitary hour to thee and our S. J.</p>

<p>Yesterday, which was the 24th of September, two Virginia officers called
at our house, and informed us that the British army had crossed the
Schuylkill.  Presently after, another person stopped and confirmed what
they had said, and that General Washington and army were near Pottsgrove.
Well, thee may be sure we were sufficiently scared; however, the road was
very still till evening.  About seven o'clock we heard a great noise; to
the door we all went; a large number of waggons, with about three hundred
of the Philadelphia militia: they begged for drink, and several pushed
into the house; one of those that entered was a little tipsy, and had a
mind to be saucy.  I then thought it time for me to retreat; so figure me
(mightily scared as not having presence of mind enough to face so many of
the military) running in at one door and out another, all in a shake with
fear; but after a little, seeing the officers appear gentlemanly and the
soldiers civil, I called reason to my aid; my fears were in some measure
dispelled, tho' my teeth rattled, and my hand shook like an aspin leaf.
They did not offer to take their quarters with us; so, with many
blessings and as many adieus, they marched off.  I have given the most
material occurrences of yesterday faithfully.</p>

<p>Fourth day, Sept.  25th.&mdash;This day, till 12 o'clock, the road was mighty
quiet, when Hobson Jones came riding along.  About that time he made a
stop at our door, and said the British were at Skippac road; that we
should soon see their light horse, and a party of Hessians had actually
turned into our lane.  My Dadda and Mamma gave it the credit it deserved,
for he does not keep strictly to the truth in all respects; but the
delicate, chicken-hearted Liddy and me were wretchedly scared.  We could
say nothing but "Oh! what shall we do?  What will become of us?"  These
questions only augmented the terror we were in.  Well, the fright went
off; we seen no light horse or Hessians.  O. Foulke came here in the
evening, and told us that General Washington had come down as far as the
Trap, and that General McDougle's brigade was stationed at Montgomery,
consisting of about 16 hundred men.  This he had from Dr. Edwards, Lord
Stirling's aid-de-camp; so we expected to be in the midst of one army or
t'other.</p>

<p>5th day, Sept.  26th.&mdash;We were unusually silent all the morning; no
passengers came by the house, except to the Mill, and we don't place much
dependance on Mill news.  About 12 o'clock, cousin Jesse heard that
General Howe's army had moved down towards Philadelphia.  Then, my dear,
our hopes and fears were engaged for you.  However, my advice is, summon
up all your resolution, call Fortitude to your aid, don't suffer your
spirits, to sink, my dear; there's nothing like courage; 'tis what I
stand in need of myself, but unfortunately have but little of it in my
composition.  I was standing in the kitchen about 12, when somebody came
to me in a hurry, screaming, "Sally, Sally, here are the light horse."
This was by far the greatest fright which I had endured; fear tack'd
wings to my feet; I was at the house in a moment; at the porch I stopt,
and it really was the light horse.  I run immediately to the Western
door, where the family were assembled anxiously waiting for the event.
They rode up to the door and halted, and enquired if we had horses to
sell; he was answer'd negatively.  "Have not you, sir," to my father,
"two black horses?"  "Yes, but have no mind to dispose of them."  My
terror had by this time nearly subsided.  The officer and men behaved
perfectly civil; the first drank two glasses of wine, rode away, bidding
his men follow, which, after adieus in number, they did.  The officer was
Lieutenant Lindsay, of Bland's regiment, Lee's troop.  The men, to our
great joy, were Americans, and but 4 in all!  What made us imagine them
British, they wore blue and red, which with us is not common.  It has
rained all this afternoon, and, to present appearances, will all night.
In all probability the English will take possession of the city to-morrow
or next day.  What a change will it be!  May the Almighty take you under
his protection, for without his Divine aid all human assistance is vain.</p>

<p>May Heaven's guardian arm protect my absent friends,</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<p>                        "From danger guard them,<br>
                         and from want defend."</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Forgive, my dear, the repetition of those lines, but they just darted
into my mind.</p>

<p>Nothing worth relating has occurred this afternoon.  Now for trifles.
I have set a stocking on the needles, and intend to be mighty
industrious!  This evening some of our folks heard a very heavy cannon.
We suppose it to be fired by the English.  The report seem'd to come from
Philadelphia.  We hear the American army will be within five miles of us
to-night.  The uncertainty of our position engrosses me quite; perhaps to
be in the midst of war and ruin and the clang of arms!  But we must hope
the best.</p>

<p>Here, my dear, passes an interval of several weeks, in which nothing
happen'd worth the time and paper it would take to write it.  The
English, however, in the interim had taken possession of the city.</p>

<p>
Oct the 19th, second day.&mdash;Now for new and uncommon scenes!  As I was
laying in bed and ruminating on past and present events, and thinking how
happy I should be if I could see you, Liddy came running into the room,
and said there was the greatest drumming, fifing, and rattling of waggons
that ever she had heard.  What to make of this we were at a loss.  We
dress'd, and down stairs in a hurry.  Our wonder ceased: the British had
left Germantown, and our army were marching to take possession.  It was
the general opinion they would evacuate the capital.  Sister B. and
myself and G. E. went about half a mile from home, where we could see the
army pass.  Thee will stare at my going, but no impropriety in my opine,
or I should not have gone.  We made no great stay, but return'd with
excellent appetites for our breakfast.  Several officers call'd to get
some refreshments, but none of consequence till the afternoon.  Cousin P.
and myself were sitting at the door; I in a green skirt, dark short-gown,
&amp;c.  Two genteel men of the military order rode up to the door: "Your
servant, ladies," &amp;c.; ask'd if they could have quarters for General
Smallwood.  Aunt F. thought she could accommodate them as well as most of
her neighbors; said they could.  One of the officers dismounted, and
wrote "SMALLWOOD'S QUARTERS" over the door, which secured us from
straggling soldiers.  After this he mounted his steed and rode away.
When we were alone, our dress and lips were put in order for conquest,
and the hopes of adventures gave brightness to each before passive
countenance.  Thee must be told of a Dr. Gould, who, by accident, had
made acquaintance with my father,&mdash;a sensible, conversible man, a
Carolinian,&mdash;and had come to bid us adieu.  Daddy had prevailed on him to
stay a day or two with us.  In the evening his Generalship came, with six
attendants, which compos'd his family; a large guard of soldiers, a
number of horses and baggage-waggons, the yard and house in confusion,
and glitter'd with military equipments.  Gould was intimate with
Smallwood, and had gone into Jesse's to see him: while he was there,
there was great running up and down stairs, so I had an opportunity of
seeing and being seen: the former the most agreeable, to be sure.  One
person, in particular, attracted my notice: he appear'd cross and
reserv'd; but thee shall see how agreeably disappointed I was.  Dr. Gould
usher'd the gentlemen into our parlour, and introduc'd them&mdash;"Gen.
Smallwood, Capt. Furnival, Major Stodard, Mr. Prig, Capt. Finley, and Mr.
Clagan, Col. Wood, and Col. Line."  These last two did not come with the
Gen'l; they are Virginians, and both indispos'd.  The Gen'l and suite are
Marylanders.  Be assur'd I did not stay long with so many men, but
secur'd a good retreat, heart-safe so far.  Some sup'd with us, others at
Jesse's; they retir'd about in in good order.  How new is our situation!
I feel in good spirits, though surrounded by an army, the house full of
officers, the yard alive with soldiers,&mdash;very peaceable sort of people,
tho'; they eat like other folks, talk like them, and behave themselves
with elegance; so I will not be afraid of them, that I won't!  Adieu.
I am going to my chamber, to dream, I suppose, of bayonets and swords,
sashes, guns, and epaulets.</p>

<p>
3d day morn, Oct 20th.&mdash;I dare say thee is impatient to know my
sentiments of the officers; so, while Somnus embraces them, and the house
is still, take their characters according to their rank.  The Gen'l is
tall, portly, well made: a truly martial air, the behaviour and manners
of a gentleman, a good understanding, and great humanity of disposition,
constitute the character of Smallwood.  Col. Wood, from what we hear of
him, and what we see, is one of the most amiable of men; tall and
genteel, an agreeable countenance and deportment.  The following lines
will more fully characterize him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>              "How skill'd he is in each obliging art,<br>
               The mildest manners and the bravest heart."</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>The cause he is fighting for alone tears him from the society of an
amiable wife and engaging daughter; with tears in his eyes he often
mentions the sweets of domestic life.  Col. Line is not married; so let
me not be too warm in his praise, least you suspect.  He is monstrous
tall and brown, but has a certain something in his face and conversation
very agreeable; he entertains the highest notions of honour, is sensible
and humane, and a brave officer; he is only seven and twenty years old,
but, by a long indisposition and constant fatigue, looks vastly older,
and almost worn to a skeleton, but very lively and talkative.  Capt.
Furnival&mdash;I need not say more of him, than that he has, excepting one or
two, the handsomest face I ever seen, a very fine person, fine light
hair, and a great deal of it adds to the beauty of his face.  Well, here
comes the glory, the Major, so bashful, so famous, &amp;c., he should come
before the Captain, but never mind.  I at first thought the Major cross
and proud, but I was mistaken; he is about nineteen, nephew to the Gen'l,
and acts as Major of brigade to him; he cannot be extoll'd for the graces
of person, but for those of the mind he may justly be celebrated; he is
large in his person, manly, and an engaging countenance and address.
Finley is wretched ugly, but he went away last night, so I shall not
particularize him.  Nothing of any moment to-day; no acquaintance with
the officers.  Col's Wood and Line, and Gould, dined with us.  I was
dress'd in my chintz, and looked smarter than night before.</p>

<p>
Fourth day, Oct. 21st.&mdash;I just now met the Major, very reserv'd: nothing
but "Good morning," or "Your servant, Madam;" but Furnival is most
agreeable; he chats every opportunity, but luckily has a wife!  I have
heard strange things of the Major.  With a fortune of thirty thousand
pounds, independent of any body; the Major moreover is vastly bashful; so
much so he can hardly look at the ladies.  (Excuse me, good sir;&mdash;I
really thought you were not clever; if 'tis bashfulness only, will drive
that away.)</p>

<p>
Fifth day, sixth day, and seventh day pass'd.  The Gen' still here; the
Major still bashful.</p>

<p>
First day evening.&mdash;Prepare to hear amazing things.  The Gen'l was
invited to dine, was engag'd; but Col. Wood, Major Stodard, and Dr.
Edwards din'd with us.  In the afternoon, Stodard addressing himself to
mamma, "Pray, ma'am, do you know Miss Nancy Bond?"  I told him of the
amiable girl's death.  This Major had been at Philada College.  In the
evening, I was diverting Johnny at the table, when he drew his chair to
it, and began to play with the child.  I ask'd him if he knew N. Bond.
"No, ma'am, but I have seen her very often."  One word brought on another
one.  We chatted a great part of the evening.  He said he knew me
directly as he seen me; told me exactly where we liv'd.  It rains, so
adieu.</p>

<p>
Second day, 26th Oct.&mdash;A rainy morning&mdash;so like to prove: the officers in
the house all day.</p>

<p>Second day afternoon.&mdash;The Gen'l and officers drank tea with us, and
stay'd part of the evening.  After supper, I went with aunt where sat the
Gen'l, Col. Line, and Major Stodard; so Liddy and me seated ourselves at
the table, in order to read a verse-book.  The Major was holding a candle
for the Gen'l, who was reading a newspaper; he look'd at us, turn'd away
his eyes, look'd again, put the candlestick down, up he jumps, out of the
door he went!  "Well," said I to Liddy, "he will join us when he comes
in."  Presently he return'd, and seated himself on the table.  "Pray,
ladies, is there any songs in that book?"  "Yes, many."  "Can't you favor
me with a sight of it?"  "No, Major: 'tis a borrow'd book."  "Miss Sally,
can't you sing?"  "No."  Thee may be sure I told the truth there.  Liddy,
saucy girl, told him I could.  He beg'd, and I deny'd; for my voice is
not much better than the voice of a raven!  We talk'd and laugh'd for an
hour; he is clever, amiable, and polite; he has the softest voice&mdash;never
pronounces the r at all.</p>

<p>I must tell thee, to-day arriv'd Col, Guest and Major Leatherberry, the
former a smart widower, the latter a lawyer, a sensible young fellow, and
will never swing for want of tongue!  Dr. Diggs came second day, a mighty
disagreeable man.  We were oblig'd to ask him to tea.  He must needs pop
himself between the Major and me! for which I did not thank him.  After I
had drank tea, I jump'd from the table, and seated myself at the fire.
The M follow'd my example, drew his chair close to mine, and entertain'd
me very agreeably.  Oh! Debby, I have a thousand things to tell thee!  I
shall give thee so droll an account of my adventures, that thee will
smile.  No occasion of that, Sally, methinks I hear thee, say, for thee
tells me every trifle.  But, child, thee is mistaken; for I have not told
thee half the civil things that are said of us SWEET creatures at
"General Smallwood's Quarters!"  I think I might have sent the gentlemen
to their chambers.  I made my adieus, and home I went.</p>

<p>
Third day morn.&mdash;A polite "Good morning" from the M; more sociable than
ever.  No wonder a stoic cou'd not resist such affable damsels as we are.</p>

<p>Third day eve, Oct. 27.&mdash;We had again the pleasure of the Gen'l and suite
at afternoon tea.  He (the Gen'l, I mean) is most agreeable; so lively, so
free, and chats so gaily, that I had quite an esteem for him.  I must
steel my heart!  Capt. Furnival is gone to Baltimore, the residence of
his belov'd wife.  The Major and I had a little chat to ourselves this
eve.  No harm, I assure thee: he and I are friends.</p>

<p>This eve came a parson belonging to the army.  He is (how shall I
describe him?) near seven foot high, thin and meagre, not a single
personal charm, and very few mental ones.  He fell violently in love with
Liddy at first sight; the first discover'd conquest that has been made
since the arrival of the Gen'l.  Come, shall we chat about Col. Guest?
He's very pretty; a charming person; his eyes are exceptionable; very
stern; and he so rolls them about that mine always fall under them.  He
bears the character of a brave officer: another admirer of Liddy's, and
she is of him.  When will Sally's admirers appear?  Ah! that indeed.
Why, Sally has not charms sufficient to pierce the heart of a soldier!
But still I won't despair.  Who knows what mischief I yet may do?</p>

<p>Well, Debby, here's Doctor Edwards come again.  Now we shall not want
clack; for he has a perpetual motion in his head; and if he were not so
clever as he is, we should get tired.</p>

<p>
Fourth day, Oct. 28.&mdash;Nothing material engaged us to-day.</p>

<p>
Fifth day, Oct. 29th.&mdash;I walked into aunt's this evening.  I met the
Major.  Well, thee will think I am writing his history; but not so.
Pleased with the rencounter.  Betsy, Stodard, and myself, seated by the
fire, chatted away an hour in lively, agreeable conversation.  I can't
pretend to write all he said; but he shone in every subject that was
talk'd of.</p>

<p>Nothing of consequence on the 30th.</p>

<p>
Seventh day, Oct. 31st.&mdash;A most charming day.  I walked to the door and
received the salutation of the morn from Stodard and other officers.  As
often as I go to the door, so often have I seen the Major.  We chat
passingly, as, "A fine day, Miss Sally."  "Yes, very fine, Major."</p>

<p>Seventh day night.&mdash;Another very charming conversation with the young
Marylander.  He seems possess'd of very amiable manners; sensible and
agreeable.  He has by his unexceptionable deportment engag'd my esteem.</p>

<p>
First day morn.&mdash;Liddy, Betsy, and a T&mdash;y prisoner of state went to the
Mill.  We made very free with some Continental flour.  We powder'd mighty
white, to be sure.  Home we came.  Col. Wood was standing at a window
with a young officer.  He gave him a push forward, as much as to say,
Observe what fine girls we have here!  For all I do not mention Wood as
often as he deserves, it is not because we are not sociable: we are very
much so, and he is often at our house.  Liddy and I had a kind of
adventure with him this morn.  We were in his chamber, chatting about our
little affairs, and no idea of being interrupted; we were standing up,
each an arm on a chest of drawers; the door bang'd open!  Col. Wood was
in the room; we started! the colour flew into our faces and crimson'd us
over; the tears flew into my eyes.  It was very silly; but his coming was
so abrupt!!  He was between us and the door.  "Ladies, do not be scar'd;
I only want something from my portmanteau; I beg you not to be
disturb'd."  We ran by him, like two partridges, into mamma's room, threw
ourselves into chairs, and reproach'd each other for being so foolish as
to blush and look so silly!  I was very much vex'd at myself; so was
Liddy.  The Colonel laugh'd at us, and it blew over.</p>

<p>The army had orders to march to-day; the regulars accordingly did.  Gen'l
Smallwood had the command of militia at that time, and they, being in the
rear, were not to leave their encampment until second day.  Observe how
militaryish I talk.  No wonder, when I am surrounded by people of that
order.  The Gen'l, Colonels Wood, Guest, Crawford, and Line, Majors
Stodard and Leatherberry, din'd with us to-day.  After dinner, Liddy,
Betsy, and thy smart journaliser put on their bonnets to take a walk.  We
left the house.  I naturally look'd back, when, behold! the two Majors
seem'd debating whether to follow us or not.  Liddy said, "We shall have
their attendance;" but I did not think so.  They open'd the gate and came
fast after us.  They overtook us about ten pole from home, and beg'd
leave to attend us.  No fear of a refusal.  They inquir'd when we were
going to neighbour Roberts's.  "We will introduce you to his daughters:
you us to Genl Stevens."  The affair was concluded, and we shorten'd the
way with lively conversation.  Our intention of going to Roberts's was
frustrated; the rain that had fallen lately had raised Wissahickon too
high to attempt crossing it on foot.  We alter'd the plan of our ramble,
left the road, and walk'd near two miles thro' the woods.  Mr.
Leatherberry, observing my locket, repeated the lines,</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>         "On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore,<br>
          That Jews might kiss, and infidels adore."</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>I reply'd my trinket bore no resemblance to a cross.  "Tis something
better, madam."  'Tis nonsense to repeat all that was said; my memory is
not so obliging; but it is sufficient that nothing happen'd during our
little excursion but what was very agreeable and entirely consistent with
the strictest rules of politeness and decorum.  I was vex'd a little at
tearing my muslin petticoat.  I had on my white dress, quite as nice as a
first-day in town.  We return'd home safe.  Smallwood, Wood, and Stodard
drank tea with us, and spent the greater part of the evening.  I declare
this gentleman is very, very entertaining; so good natur'd, so good
humor'd,&mdash;yes, so sensible; I wonder he is not married.  Are there no
ladies form'd to his taste?  Some people, my dear, think that there's no
difference between good nature and good humour; but, according to my
opinion, they differ widely.  Good nature consists in a naturally amiable
and even disposition, free from all peevishness and fretting.  It is
accompanied by a natural gracefulness,&mdash;a manner of saying every thing
agreeably: in short, it steals the senses, and captivates the heart.
Good humour is a very agreeable companion for an afternoon; but give me
good nature for life.  Adieu.</p>

<p>
Second day morn, Nov. 1st.&mdash;To-day the militia marches, and the Gen'l and
officers leave us; heigh ho' I am very sorry; for when you have been with
agreeable people, 'tis impossible not to feel regret when they bid you
adieu, perhaps for ever.  When they leave us we shall be immur'd in
solitude.  The Major looks dull.</p>

<p>Second day noon.&mdash;About two o'clock, the Gen'l and Major came to bid us
adieu; with daddy and mammy they shook hands very friendly; to us they
bow'd politely: our hearts were full.  I thought the Major was affected;
"Good-by, Miss Sa&mdash;ly," spoken very low.  We stood at the door to take a
last look, all of us very sober.  The Major turn'd his horse's head, and
rode back; dismounted; "I have forgot my pistols;" pass'd us, and run up
stairs.  He came swiftly back to us, as if wishing, through inclination,
to stay,&mdash;by duty compell'd to go.  He remounted his horse: "Farewell,
ladies, till I see you again," and canter'd away!  We look'd at him till
the turn in the road hid him from our sight.  "Amiable Major! clever
fellow! good young man!"  was echoed from one to the other.  I wonder if
we shall ever see him again!  He has our wishes for his safety.</p>

<p>Well, here's uncle Miles; heartily glad of that am I.  His family are
well, and at Reading.</p>

<p>Second day even.&mdash;Jesse, who went with the Gen'l, return'd.  We had a
compliment from the Gen'l and Major.  They are very well disposed of at
Evan Meredith's, six miles from here.  I wrote to P. F. by uncle Miles,
who waited on Gen'l Washington next morn.&mdash;[General Washington and army
at Valley Forge.&mdash;Ed.]</p>

<p>
Third day morn.&mdash;It seems strange not to see our house as it used to be.
We are very still.  No rattling of waggons, glittering of musquets!  The
beating of the distant drum is all we hear.  Col's Wood, Line, Guest, and
M. Leatherberry, are still here: the two last leave to-day.  Wood and
Line will soon bid us adieu.  Amiable Wood! he is esteem'd by all that
know him; everybody has a good word for him.</p>

<p>
Here I skip a week or two, nothing of consequence occurring.  (Wood and
Line are gone.)  Some time since arriv'd two officers, Lieutenants Lee
and Warring, Virginians.  I had only the salutations of the morn from
them.  Lee is not remarkable one way or the other; Warring, an
insignificant piece enough.  Lee sings prettyly, and talks a great deal;
how good Turkey hash and fried hominy is, (a pretty discourse to
entertain the ladies!)&mdash;extols Virginia, and execrates Maryland, which,
by-the-by, I provok'd them to; for, though I admire both Virginia and
Maryland, I laugh'd at the former and prais'd the latter; ridicul'd their
manner of speaking.  I took a great delight in teazing them.  I believe I
did it sometimes ill-natur'dly; but I don't care.  They were not, I am
certain almost, first-rate gentlemen; (how different from our other
officers!) but they are gone to Virginia, where they may sing, dance, and
eat fry'd hominy and Turkey hash all day long, if they choose.  Nothing
scarcely lowers a man in my opinion more than talking of eating, what
they love and what they hate.  Lee and Warring were proficients in this
science.  Enough of them.</p>

<p>
December 5th, sixth day.&mdash;Oh, gracious!  Debby, I am all alive with fear.
The English have come out to attack (as we imagine) our army, three miles
this side.  What will become of us?  Only six miles distant.  We are in
hourly expectation of an engagement!  I fear we shall be in the midst of
it.  Heaven defend us from so dreadful a sight!  The battle of Germantown
and the horrors of that day are recent in my mind.  It will be
sufficiently dreadful, if we are only in hearing of the firing, to think
how many of our fellow-creatures are plung'd into the boundless ocean of
eternity, few of them prepar'd to meet their fate.  But they are summon'd
before an all-merciful judge, from whom they have a great deal to hope.</p>

<p>
Seventh day, December 6th.&mdash;No firing this morn.  I hope for one more
quiet day.</p>

<p>Seventh day noon, 4 o'clock.&mdash;I was much alarm'd just now, sitting in the
parlour, indulging melancholy reflections, when somebody burst open the
door.  "Sally, here's Major Stodard!"  I jump'd.  Our conjectures were
various concerning his coming.  The poor fellow, from great fatigue and
want of rest, together with being expos'd to the night air,&mdash;had caught
cold, which brought on a fever.  He cou'd scarcely walk, and I went into
aunt's to see him.  I was surpris'd; instead of the lively, alert,
blooming Stodard, who was on his feet the instant we enter'd, he look'd
pale, thin, and dejected, too weak to rise, and "How are you, Miss
Sally?"  "How does thee do, Major?"  I seated myself near him, inquir'd
the cause of his indisposition, ask'd for the Gen'l, receiv'd his
compliments; not willing to fatigue him with too much chat, I bid him
adieu.  To-night Aunt H&mdash;&mdash; F&mdash;&mdash;-, sent, administer'd something.  Jesse
assisted him to his chamber.  He had not lain down five minutes before he
was fast asleep.  Adieu.  I hope we shall enjoy a good night's rest.</p>

<p>
First day morn, December 7th.&mdash;I trip'd into aunt's.  There sat the
Major, rather more like himself.  How natural it was to see him!  "Good
morning, Miss Sally."  "Good morrow, Major; how does thee do to-day?"
"I feel quite recover'd, Sally."  "Well, I fancy this indisposition has
sav'd thy head this time."  Major: "No, ma'am; for, if I hear a firing,
I shall soon be with them."  That was heroic.  About eleven, I dress'd
myself; silk and cotton gown: it is made without an apron.  I feel quite
awkwardish, and prefer the girlish dress.</p>

<p>First day afternoon.&mdash;A Mr. Seaton and Stodard drank tea with us.  He and
me had a little private chat after tea.  In the evn, Seaton went into
aunt's; mamma went to see Prissa, who is poorly; papa withdrew to talk to
some strangers.  Liddy just then came in; so we engag'd in an agreeable
conversation.  I beg'd him to come and give us a circumstantial account
of the battle, if there should be one.  "I certainly will, ma'am, if I am
favor'd with my life."  Liddy, unluckily, took it into her head to
blunder out something about a person being in the kitchen who had come
from the army.  Stodard, ever anxious to hear, jump'd up; "Good night to
you, ladies," was the word, and he disappear'd, but not forever.  "Liddy,
thee hussy! what business had thee to mention a word of the army?  Thee
sees it sent him off!  Thy evil genius prevail'd, and we all feel the
effects of it."  "Lord bless me!"  said Liddy, "I had not a thought of
his going, or for ten thousand worlds I would not have spoke."  But we
cannot recall the past!  Well, we laugh'd and chatted at a noisy rate,
till a summons for Liddy parted us.  I sat negligently on my chair, and
thought brought thought, and I got so low-spirited that I cou'd hardly
speak.  The dread of an engagement,&mdash;the dreadful situation (if a battle
should ensue) we should be in, join'd to my anxiety for P. F. and family,
who would be in the midst of the scene,&mdash;was the occasion; and yet I did
not feel half so frighten'd as I expected to be.  'Tis amazing how we get
reconciled to such things!  Six months ago the bare idea of being within
ten, aye! twenty miles of a battle wou'd almost have distracted me; and
now, tho' two such large army's are within six miles of us, we can
converse calmly of it.  It verifies the old proverb, "Use is second
nature."</p>

<p>I forgot one little piece of intelligence, in which the girls say I
discover'd a particular partiality for our Marylander; but I disclaim any
thing of the kind.  These saucy creatures are forever finding out
wonders, and forever metamorphosing molehills into mountains.</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<p>                   "Friendship I offer, pure and free;<br>
                    And who, with such a friend as me,<br>
                    Cou'd ask or wish for more?"</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>If they charg'd thee with vanity, Sally, it wou'd not be very unjust.
Debby Norris! be quiet; no reflections, or I have done.  But the piece of
intelligence: Sally, is just coming, Debby.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we heard platoon-firing.  Everybody was at the door; I
in the horrors.  The armies, as we judg'd, were engag'd.  Very compos'dly
says the Major to our servant, "Will you be kind enough to saddle my
horse?  I shall go!"  Accordingly the horse was taken from the quiet,
hospitable barn to plunge into the thickest ranks of war.  Cruel change!
Seaton insisted to the Major that the armies were still; nothing but
skirmishing with the flanking parties; do not go.  We happen'd (us girls,
I mean) to be standing in the kitchen, the Major passing thro' in a hurry,
and I, forsooth, discover'd a strong partiality by saying, "Oh!  Major,
thee is not going!"  He turn'd round, "Yes I am, Miss Sally," bow'd, and
went into the road; we all pitied him; the firing rather decreas'd; and,
after persuasions innumerable from my father and Seaton, and the firing
over, he reluctantly agreed to stay.  Ill as he was, he would have gone.
It show'd his bravery, of which we all believe him possess'd of a large
share.</p>

<p>
Second day, December 8th.&mdash;Rejoice with us, my dear.  The British have
return'd to the city.  Charming, this.  May we ever be thankful to the
Almighty Disposer of events for his care and protection of us while
surrounded with dangers.  Major went to the army.  Nothing for him to do;
so return'd.</p>

<p>
3d or 4th day, I forget which, he was very ill; kept his chamber most of
the dav.  In the evening I seen him.  I pity him mightily, but pity is a
poor remedy!</p>

<p>
Fifth day, December 11th.&mdash;Our army mov'd, as we thought, to go into
winter quarters; but we hear there is a party of the enemy gone over
Schuylkill; so our army went to look at them!  I observ'd to Stodard,
"So you are going to leave us to the English!"  "Yes! ha! ha! hah!  leave
you for the E&mdash;&mdash;-!"  He has a certain indifference about him that, to
strangers, is not very pleasing.  He sometimes is silent for minutes.
One of these silent fits was interrupted the other day by his clasping
his hands, and exclaiming aloud, "Oh, my God, I wish this war was at an
end!"</p>

<p>Noon.&mdash;The Major gone to camp.  I don't think we shall see him again.
Well, strange creature that I am! here have I been going on without
giving thee an account of two officers,&mdash;one who will be a principal
character; their names are Capt. Lipscomb and a Mr. Tilly; the former a
tall, genteel man, very delicate from indisposition, and has a softness
in his countenance that is very pleasing, and has the finest head of hair
that I ever saw; 'tis a light shining auburn.  The fashion of his hair
was this,&mdash;negligently ty'd and waving down his back.  Well may it be
said,</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>          "Loose flow'd the soft redundance of his hair."</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>He has not hitherto shown himself a lady's man, tho' he is perfectly
polite.</p>

<p>Now let me attempt a character of Tilly.  He seems a wild, noisy mortal,
tho' I am not much acquainted with him.  He appears bashful when with
girls.  We dissipated the Major's bashfulness; but I doubt we have not so
good a subject now.  He is above the common size, rather genteel, an
extreme pretty, ruddy face, hair brown and a sufficiency of it, a very
great laugher, and talks so excessively fast that he often begins a
sentence without finishing the last, which confuses him very much, and
then he blushes and laughs; and, in short, he keeps me in perpetual good
humour; but the creature has not address'd one civil thing to me since he
came!  But I have not done with his accomplishments yet, for he is a
musician,&mdash;that is, he plays on the German flute, and has it here.</p>

<p>Fifth day night.&mdash;The family retir'd; take the adventures of the
afternoon as they occur'd.  Seaton and Capt. Lipscomb drank tea with us.
While we sat at tea the parlour door was open'd; in came Tilly; his
appearance was elegant; he had been riding; the wind had given the most
beautiful glow to his cheeks, and blow'd his hair carelessly round his
cheeks.  Oh, my heart, thought I, be secure!  The caution was needless;
I found it without a wish to stray.</p>

<p>When the tea equipage was remov'd, the conversation turn'd on
politicks,&mdash;a subject I avoid.  I gave Betsy a hint; I rose, she followed, and we
went to seek Lyddy.  We chatted a few moments at the door; the moon shone
with uncommon splendour; our spirits were high.  I proposed a walk; the
girls agreed.  When we reach'd the Poplar-tree we stopp'd.  Our ears were
assailed by a number of voices.  "A party of light horse," said one; "the
English, perhaps; let's run home."  "No, no," said I; "be heroines."  At
last two or three men on horseback came in sight.  We walked on.  The
well-known voice of the Major saluted our hearing with, "How do you do,
ladies!"  We turn'd ourselves about with one accord.  He, not relishing
the idea of sleeping on the banks of the Schuylkill, had return'd to the
Mill.  We chatted along the road till we reach'd our hospitable mansion.
Stodard dismounted and went into Jesse's parlour.  I sat there a
half-hour.  He is very amiable.  Lipscomb, Seaton, Tilly, and my father,
hearing of his return, and impatient for the news, came in at one door,
while I made my exit at the other.</p>

<p>I am vex'd at Tilly, who has his flute, and does nothing but play the
fool.  He begins a tune, plays a note or so, then stops.  Well, after a
while he begins again; stops again: "Will that do, Seaton?  Hah! hah!
hah!"  He has given us but two regular tunes since he arriv'd.  I am
passionately fond of music.  How boyish he behaves!</p>

<p>
Sixth day, December 12th, 1777.&mdash;I run into aunt's this morning to chat
with the girls.  Major Stodard join'd us in a few minutes.  I verily
believe the man is fond of the ladies, and, what to me is astonishing,
he has not display'd the smallest degree of pride.  Whether he is artful
enough to conceal it under the veil of humility, or whether he has none,
is a question; but I am inclined to think it the latter.  I really am of
opinion that there is few of the young fellows of the modern age exempt
from vanity, more especially those who are bless'd with exterior graces.
If they have a fine pair of eyes, they are forever rolling them about;
a fine set of teeth, mind, they are great laughers; a genteel person,
forever changing their attitudes to show them to advantage.  Oh, vanity!
vanity! how boundless is thy sway!</p>

<p>But to resume.  This interview with Major Stodard we were very witty and
sprightly.  I was darning an apron, upon which he was pleas'd to
compliment me.  "Well, Miss Sally, what would you do if the British were
to come here?"  "Do?"  exclaim'd I: "be frighten'd just to death!"  He
laugh'd, and said he would escape their rage by getting behind the
representation of a British grenadier that you have up stairs.  "Of all
things I should like to frighten Tilly with it.  Pray, ladies, let's fix
it in his chamber to-night."  "If thee will take all the blame, we will
assist thee."  "That I will," he replied; and this was the plan: We had
brought some weeks ago a British grenadier from uncle Miles's on purpose
to divert us: it is remarkably well executed, six foot high, and makes a
martial appearance.  This we agreed to stand at the door that opens into
the road, (the house has four rooms on a floor, with a wide entry running
through,) with another figure that would add to the deceit.  One of our
servants was to stand behind them; others were to serve as occasion
offer'd.  After half an hour's converse, in which we rais'd our
expectations to the highest pitch, we parted.  If our scheme answers, I
shall communicate it in the eve.  Till then, adieu.</p>

<p>
Sixth day night.&mdash;Never did I more sincerely wish to possess a
descriptive genius than I do now.  All that I can write will fall
infinitely short of the truly diverting scene that I have been witness of
to-night!  But, as I mean to attempt an account, I had as well shorten
the preface and begin the story.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the evening I went to Liddy and beg'd her to secure
the swords and pistols which were in their parlour.  The Marylander,
hearing our voices, joined us.  I told him of our proposal.  Whether he
thought it a good one or not I can't say, but he approv'd of it, and
Liddy went in and brought her apron full of swords and pistols.  When
this was done, Stodard join'd the officers.  We girls went and stood at
the first landing of the stairs.  The gentlemen were very merry, and
chatting on public affairs, when Seaton's negro (observe that Seaton
being indisposed was appriz'd of the scheme) open'd the door, a candle in
his hand, and said, "There's somebody at the door that wishes to see
you."  "Who?  All of us?"  said Tilly.  "Yes, sir," said the boy.  They
all rose, (the Major, as he said afterwards, almost dying with laughter,)
and walked into the entry, Tilly first in full expectation of news.  The
first object that struck his view was a British soldier!</p>

<blockquote>
 <p> [Singularly enough, this identical effigy of a grenadier has been
     preserved by the owner of the manuscript, and, by permission, we are
     enabled to present a drawing of it, colour and all.  It is admirably
     painted on half-inch board, carved out at the edges, and may have
     been from the brush of Major Andre.&mdash;ED.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a moment his ears were saluted with, a "Is there any rebel officers
here?"  in a thundering voice.  Not waiting for a second word, he darted
like lightning out of the front door, through the yard, bolted o'er the
fence.  Swamp, fences, thorn-hedges, and plough'd fields no way impeded
his retreat!  He was soon out of hearing.  The woods echoed with, "Which
way did he go?  Stop him!  Surround the house!"  The amiable Lipscomb had
his hand on the latch of the door, intending to make his escape; Stodard,
considering his indisposition, acquainted him with the deceit.  We
females ran down stairs to join the general laugh.  I walked into Jesse's
parlour.  There sat poor Stodard, (whose sore lips must have receiv'd no
advantage from this) almost convuls'd with laughing, rolling in an
arm-chair.  He said nothing; I believe he could not have spoke.  "Major
Stodard," said I, "go to call Tilly back.  He will lose himself,&mdash;indeed
he will;" every word interrupted with a "Ha! ha!"  At last he rose, and
went to the door; and what a loud voice could avail in bringing him back
he tried.  Figure to thyself this Tilly, of a snowy
evening,&mdash;no hat,&mdash;shoes down at heel,&mdash;hair unty'd,&mdash;flying across meadows, creeks, and
mud-holes.  Flying from what?  Why, a bit of painted wood!  But he was
ignorant of what it was.  The idea of being made a prisoner wholly
engross'd his mind, and his last resource was to run!</p>

<p>After a while, we being in more composure, and our bursts of laughter
less frequent, yet by no means subsided,&mdash;in full assembly of girls and
officers,&mdash;Tilly enter'd!  The greatest part of my risibility turn'd to
pity.  Inexpressible confusion had taken entire possession of his
countenance,&mdash;his fine hair hanging dishevell'd down his shoulders, all
splashed with mud; yet his bright confusion and race had not divested him
of his beauty.  He smil'd as he trip'd up the steps; but 'twas vexation
plac'd it on his features.  Joy at that moment was banish'd from his
heart!  He briskly walk'd five or six steps, then stop'd, and took a
general survey of us all.  "Where have you been, Mr. Tilly?"  ask'd one
officer.  (We girls were silent.)  "I really imagin'd," said Major
Stodard, "that you were gone for your pistols.  I follow'd you to prevent
danger!"&mdash;an excessive laugh at each question, which it was impossible to
restrain.  "Pray, where were your pistols, Tilly?"  He broke his silence
by the following expression: "You may all go to the D&mdash;-l!"  I never
heard him utter an indecent expression before.</p>

<p>At last his good nature gain'd a compleat ascendence over his anger, and,
he join'd heartily in the laugh.  I will do him the justice to say that
he bore it charmingly.  No cowardly threats, no vengeance denounced.
Stodard caught hold of his coat,&mdash;"Come, look at what you ran away
from,"&mdash;and drag'd him to the door.  He gave it a look, said it was very
natural, and, by the singularity of his expressions, gave fresh cause for
diversion.  We all retir'd to our different parlours, for the rest of our
faces, if I may say so.</p>

<p>Well, certainly these military folks will laugh all night.  Such
screaming I never did hear!!  Adieu to-night.</p>

<p>
December 13th.&mdash;I am fearful they will yet carry the joke too far.  Tilly
certainly possesses an uncommon share of good nature, or he could not
tolerate these frequent teazings.  Ah! Deborah, the Major is going to
leave us entirely,&mdash;just going.  I will see him first.</p>

<p>Seventh day noon.&mdash;He has gone!  I seen him pass the bridge.  The woods
which you enter immediately after crossing it hinder'd us from following
him further.  I seem to fancy he will return in the evening.</p>

<p>Seventh day night.&mdash;Stodard not come back!  We shall not, I fancy, see
him again for months, perhaps for years! unless he should visit Philadl.
We shall miss his agreeable company.  But what shall we make of Tilly?
No civil things yet from him.  Adieu to-night, my dear.</p>

<p>
December 14th.&mdash;The officers yet here.  No talk of their departure.  They
are very lively; Tilly's retreat the occasion,&mdash;the principal one at
least.</p>

<p>First day night.&mdash;Capt. Lipscomb, Seaton, and Tilly, with cousin H. M.,
dined with us to-day.  Such an everlasting bore as Tilly I never knew.
He caused us a good deal of diversion while we sat at table.  Has not
said a syllable to one of us young ladies since sixth day eve.  He tells
Lipscomb that the Major had the assistance of the ladies in the execution
of the scheme.  He tells a truth!</p>

<p>About four o'clock, I was standing at the door, leaning my head on my
hand, when a genteel officer rode up to the gate and dismounted; "Your
servant, ma'am," and gave me the compliment of his hat; went into aunt's.
I went into our parlour.  Soon Seaton was call'd.  Many minutes had not
elapsed before he enter'd with the young fellow whom I had just seen.
He introduced him by the name of Capt. Smallwood.  We seated ourselves.
I then had an opportunity of seeing him.  He is a brother to Gen'l
Smallwood,&mdash;a very genteel, pretty little fellow, very modest, and seems
agreeable, but no personal resemblance between him and the Major.  After
tea, turning to Tilly, he said, "So, sir, I have heard you had like to
have been taken prisoner last Friday night!"  "Pray, sir, who informed
you?"  "Major Stodard was my author."  "I fancy he made a fine tale of
it.  How far did he say I ran?"  "Two miles, and that you fell into the
mill-dam!"  He rais'd his eyes and hands, and exclaimed, "What a
confounded falsehood!"  The whole affair was again reviv'd.  Our Tillian
here gave a mighty droll account of his "retreat," as they call it.  He
told us that, after he had got behind our kitchen, he stop'd for company,
as he expected the others would immediately follow; "but I heard them
scream, 'Which way did he go?  Where is he?' Aye, said I to myself, he is
gone where you shan't catch him, and off I set again."  "Pray," ask'd
mamma, "did thee keep that lane between the meadows?"  "Oh, no, ma'am!
That was a large road, and I might happen to meet some of them.  When I
got to your thorn-hedge, I again stop'd.  As it was a cold night, I
thought I would pull up my shoe-heels, and tie my handkerchief round my
head.  I began to have a suspicion of a trick, and, hearing the Major
hollow, I came back."</p>

<p>I think I did not laugh more at the very time than to-night at the
rehearsal of it.  He is so good-natur'd, and takes all their jokes with
so good a grace, that I am quite charm'd with him.  He laughingly
denounces vengeance against Stodard.  He will be even with him.  He is in
the Major's debt, but he will pay him, &amp;c.</p>

<p>
December 15th.&mdash;Smallwood has taken up his quarters with us.  Nothing
worth relating occur'd to-day.</p>

<p>3d, 4th, and 5th day.&mdash;We chatted a little with the officers.  Smallwood
not so chatty as his brother or nephew.  Lipscomb is very agreeable; a
delightful musical voice.</p>

<p>
Sixth day noon, Dec. 19th.&mdash;The officers, after the politest adieus, have
left us.  Smallwood and Tilly are going to Maryland, where they live;
Seaton to Virginia, and Lipscomb to camp, to join his regiment.  I feel
sorry at this departure, yet 'tis a different kind from what I felt some
time since!  We had not contracted so great an intimacy with those last.</p>

<p>
Seventh day, December 20th.&mdash;General Washington's army have gone into
winter-quarters at the Valley Forge.  We shall not see many of the
military now.  We shall be very intimate with solitude.  I am afraid
stupidity will be a frequent guest.  After so much company, I can't
relish the idea of sequestration!</p>

<p>First day night.&mdash;A dull round of the same thing over again!  I shall
hang up my pen until something offers worth relating.</p>

<p>February third and fourth.&mdash;I thought I never should have any thing to
say again.  Nothing happen'd all January that was uncommon.  Capt.
Lipscomb and Mas stay'd one night at Jesse's, and sup'd with us.  How
elegant the former was dres'd!  And indeed I have forgot to keep an exact
account of the day of the month in which I went down to G. E.'s, with
P. F.; but it was the 23d or 24th of February.  After enjoying a week of
her agreeable company at the Mill, I return'd with her to Whitemarsh.  We
went on horseback,&mdash;the roads bad.  We however surmounted this
difficulty, and arrived there safe.</p>

<p>Second day eve.&mdash;G. E.  brought us a charming collection of books,&mdash;Joe
Andrews, Juliet Grenville, and some Lady's Magazines.  P. T.  sent us
Caroline Melmoth.</p>

<p>
4th day, 26th.&mdash;I thought our scheme of going to Fr'd F.'s was entirely
frustrated, as S. E. was much indispos'd.  About 12 she got better.  We
made some alteration in our dress, step'd into the carriage, and rode
off.  Spent a most delightful day.  As we approach'd the house, on our
return, we perceiv'd several strangers in the parlour.  Polly's face and
mine brighten'd up at the discovery.  We alighted.  Polly swung open the
door, and introduc'd us to Major Jameson and Capt. Howard, both of the
dragoons,&mdash;the former from Virginia, the latter a Marylander.  We all
seem'd in penseroso style till after supper.  We then began to be rather
more sociable.  About ten they bid us adieu.  I dare say thee is
impatient to know my sentiments of the swains!  Howard has very few
external charms; indeed, I cannot name one.  As to his internal ones, I
am not a judge.  Jameson is tall and manly,&mdash;a comely face, dark eyes and
hair,&mdash;seems to be much of a gentleman,&mdash;no ways deficient in point of
sense, or, at least, in the course of the evening I discover'd none.</p>

<p>5th and 6th day, and 7th day, pass'd away very agreeably.  No strangers.</p>

<p>First day eve.&mdash;This day my charming friend and self ascended the barren
hills of Whitemarsh, from the tops of which we had an extensive prospect
of the country round.  The traces of the army which encamp'd on these
hills are very visible.  Rugged huts, imitations of chimneys, and many
other ruinous objects which plainly show'd they had been there.
D. J. S. dined with us.</p>

<p>Second day.&mdash;Very cold and windy.  I wonder I am not sent for.  Read and
work'd by turns.</p>

<p>Third day.&mdash;A raw, snowy day.  I am sent for, nevertheless.  Adieu.
North Wales,&mdash;at my old habitation at the Mill.</p>

<p>March 1st, 1778, Third day eve.&mdash;Such a ride as I have had, O dear Debby!
About 2 o'clock the sleigh came for me.  Snowing excessively fast, though
not sufficiently deep to make it tolerable sleighing; but go I must.  I
bid adieu to my agreeable friends; and with a heavy heart and flowing
eyes, I seated myself in the unsociable vehicle.  There might as well
have been no snow on the ground.  I was jolted just to pieces; but,
notwithstanding these vexations, I got safe to my home, when I had the
great pleasure of finding my dear parents, sisters, and brothers well,&mdash;a
blessing which I hope ever to remember with thankfulness.</p>

<p>Well, will our nunnery be more bearable now than before I left it?  No
beaus since I left here; so I have the advantage of the girls.  They are
wild to see Major Jameson.</p>

<p>
May 11th, 1778.&mdash;The scarcity of paper, which is very great in this part
of the country, and the three last months not producing any thing
material, has prevented me from keeping a regular account of things; but
to-day the scene begins to brighten, and I will continue my nonsense.  In
the afternoon, we were just seated at tea,&mdash;Dr. Moore with us.  Nelly
(our girl) brought us the wonderful intelligence that there were light
horse in the road.  The tea-table was almost deserted.  About fifteen
light horse were the vanguard of 16 hundred men under the command of
Gen'l Maxwell.  I imagin'd that they would pass immediately by, but was
agreeably disappointed.  My father came in with the Gen'l, Col.
Brodhead, Major Ogden, and Capt. Jones.</p>

<p>The Gen'l is a Scotsman,&mdash;nothing prepossessing in his appearance; the
Col. very martial and fierce; Ogden, a genteel young fellow, with an
aquiline nose.  Capt. Cadwallader Jones!  If I was not invincible, I must
have fallen a victim to this man's elegancies; (but, thank my good
fortune, I am not made of susceptibilities!) tall, elegant, and
handsome,&mdash;white fac'd with blue regimentals, and a mighty airish cap and
white crest: his behaviour is refin'd,&mdash;a Virginian.  They sat a few
minutes after tea, then bid us adieu.</p>

<p>This brigade is encamp'd about three miles from us.</p>

<p>
First day evening.&mdash;This afternoon has been productive of adventures in
the true sense of the word.  Jenny R., Betsy, Liddy, and I, very genteely
dress'd, determin'd to take a stroll.  Neighbour Morgan's was proposed.
Away we rambled, heedless girls; pass'd two picket-guards.  Meeting with
no interruptions encourag'd us.  After paying our visit, we walk'd
towards home, when, to my utter astonishment, the sentry desir'd us to
stop!&mdash;that he had orders not to suffer any persons to pass but those who
had leave from the officer, who was at the guard-house surrounded by a
number of men.  To go to him would be inconsistent with propriety; to
stay there, and night advancing, was not clever.  I was much terrified.
I tried to persuade the soldier to let us pass.  "No; he dared not."
Betsy attempted to go.  He presented his gun with the bayonet fix'd.
This was an additional fright.  Back we turn'd; and, very fortunately,
the officer, (Capt. Emeson,) seeing our distress, came to us.  I ask'd
him if he had any objection to our passing the sentry?  "None at all,
ma'am."  He waited upon us, and reprimanded the man, and we, without any
farther difficulty, came home.</p>

<p>
Third day, June 2d, 1778.&mdash;I was standing at the back window; an officer
and private of dragoons rode by; I tore to the door to have a better view
of them; they stop'd; the officer rode up, and ask'd for Jesse, who was
call'd.</p>

<p>Afternoon, 4 o'clock.&mdash;Oh, Deborah! what capital adventures!  Jesse came.
The idea of having Light horse quarter'd at the farm was
disagreeable,&mdash;the meadows just fit to mow; and we had heard what destruction had
awaited their footsteps.  This was the dialogue between Jesse and the
officer:&mdash;"Pray, sir, can I have quarters for a few horsemen?"  "How
many?"  "Five and twenty, sir.  I do not mean to turn them into your
meadows.  If you have any place you can spare, any thing will do."  And
he dismounted and walk'd into aunt's parlour.  I&mdash;determin'd to find out
his character&mdash;follow'd.  "I have," reply'd Jesse, "a tolerable field
that may perhaps suit."  "That will do, sir; but if you have any
objection to putting them in a field, my men shall cut the grass and
bring it in the road.  I am under the necessity of quartering them here,
but I was order'd; I am only an inferior officer."  Some elegant
corporal, thought I, and went to the door.  He soon join'd me: speaking
to his man, "Ride off, and tell Mr. Watts we rendez-vous here."</p>

<p>He inquir'd the name of the farmer, and went into aunt's; I into the back
room.  The troop rode up.  New scenes, said I, and mov'd up-stairs, where
I saw them perform their different manoeuvres.  This Mr. Watts is
remarkably tall, and a good countenance.  I adjourn'd to our parlor.  The
first officer march'd up and down the entry.  Prissa came in.  "Good,
now, Prissa.  What's the name of this man?"  "Dyer, I believe."  "Capt.
Dyer.  Oh, the name!  What does he say?"  "Why, that he will kiss me when
he has din'd."  "Singular," I observ'd, "on so short an acquaintance."
"But," resum'd Prissa, "he came and fix'd his arm on the chair I sat in:
I Pray, ma'am, is there not a family from town with you?"  "Yes."
"What's their name?"  "Wister."  "There's two fine girls there.  I will
go chat with them.  Pray, did they leave their effects in Philadelphia?"
"Yes, every thing, almost."  "They shall have them again, that they
shall."  There ended the conversation.  But this ugly name teaz'd me!
"Oh, Sally, he is a Virginian that's in his favour greatly."  "I'm not
sure that's his name, but I understood so."  Prissa left us.  I step'd
into aunt's for Johnny, and desir'd him to come home.  Up started the
Captain: "Pray, let me introduce you, ma'am."  "I am perfectly acquainted
with him," said I, and turn'd to the door.  "Tell your sister I believe
she is not fond of strangers!"  I smil'd, and return'd to our parlour.</p>

<p>
Third day night, nine o'clock, aye, ten, I fancy.&mdash;Take a circumstantial
account of this afternoon, and the person of this extraordinary man.  His
exterior first.  His name is not Dyer, but Alexander Spotswood Dandridge,
which certainly gives a genteel idea of the man.  I will be particular.
His person is more elegantly form'd than any I ever seen; tall and
commanding; his forehead is very white, though the lower part of his face
is much sunburn'd; his features are extremely pleasing; an even, white
set of teeth; dark hair and eyes.  I can't better describe him than by
saying he is the handsomest man I ever beheld!  Betsy and Liddy coincide
in this opinion.</p>

<p>After I had set a while at home, in came Dandridge.  He enter'd into chat
immediately.  Ask'd if we knew Tacy Vanderen; said he courted her, and
that they were to be married soon.  Observ'd my sampler, which was in
full view; wish'd I would teach the Virginians some of my needle wisdom;
they were the laziest girls in the world; told his name; laugh'd and
talk'd incessantly.  At last, "May I" (to mamma) "introduce my brother
officer?"  We assented; so he call'd him.  "Mr. Watts, Mrs. Wister, young
Miss Wister; Mr. Watts, ladies, is one of our Virginia children."  He sat
down.  Tea was order'd.  Dandridge never drank tea; Watts had done; so we
set to the table alone.  "Let's walk in the garden," said the Captain; so
we call'd Liddy, and went, (not Watts.) We sat down in a sort of a
summer-house.  "Miss Sally, are you a Quaker?"  "Yes."  "Now, are you a
Quaker?"  "Yes, I am."  "Then you are a Tory."  "I am not, indeed."  "Oh,
dear!"  replied he, "I am a poor creature!  I can hardly live!"  Then,
flying away from that subject, "Will you marry me, Miss Sally?"  "No,
really!  A gentleman, after he has said he has not sufficient to maintain
himself, to ask me to marry him!"  "Never mind what I say.  I have enough
to make the pot boil!"</p>

<p>Had we been acquainted seven years, we could not have been more sociable.
The moon gave a sadly pleasing light.  We sat at the door till nine.
Dandridge is sensible, and (divested of some freedoms which might be
call'd gallant in the fashionable world) he is polite and agreeable.  His
greatest fault is a propensity to swearing, which throws a shade over his
accomplishments.  I ask'd him why he did so.  "It is a favorite vice,
Miss Sally."  At nine, he went to his chamber.  Sets off at sunrise.</p>

<p>
Fourth day morn, 12 o'clock.&mdash;I was awaken'd this morn with a great
racket of the Captain's servant calling him; but the lazy fellow never
rose till about half an hour eight!  This his daylight ride!  I imagin'd
they would be gone before now, so I dress'd in a green skirt and dark
short-gown.  Provoking!  So down I came, this Captain (wild wretch!)
standing at the back door.  He bow'd and call'd me.  I only look'd, and
went to breakfast.  About nine I took my work and seated myself in the
parlour.  Not long had I sat when in came Dandridge,&mdash;the handsomest man
in existence, at least that I had ever seen.  But stop here, while I just
say, the night before, chatting upon dress, he said he had no patience
with those officers who, every morn, before they went on detachments,
would wait to be dress'd and powder'd.  "I am," said I, "excessively fond
of powder, and think it very becoming."  "Are you?"  he reply' d.  "I am
very careless, as often wearing my cap thus" (turning the back part
before) "as any way."  I left off at where he came in.  He was powder'd
very white, a (pretty coloured) brown coat, lapell'd with green, and
white waistcoat, &amp;c., and his</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>               "sword beside him negligently hung."</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>He made a truly elegant figure.  "Good morning, Miss Sally.  You are very
well, I hope."  "Very well.  Pray sit down;"&mdash;which he did, close by me.
"Oh, dear!"  said I, "I see thee is powder'd."  "Yes, ma'am.  I have
dress'd myself off for you."  Will I be excused, Debby, if I look upon
his being powder'd in the light of a compliment to me?  Yes, Sally, as
thee is a country maid, and don't often meet with compliments.  Saucy
Debby Norris!</p>

<p>'Tis impossible to write a regular account of our conversation.  Be it
sufficient to say that we had a multiplicity of chat.</p>

<p>About an hour since, sister H. came to me and said Captain Dandridge was
in the parlour and had ask'd for me.  I went in.  He met me, caught my
hands: "Oh, Miss Sally, I have a beautiful sweetheart for you!"  "Poh!
ridiculous!  Loose my hands."  "Well, but don't be so cross!"  "Who is
he?"  "Major Clough!  I have seen him.  Ain't he pretty, to be sure?  I
am going to head-quarters.  Have you any commands there?"  "None at all;
but," (recollecting,) "yes, I have.  Pray, who is your commanding
officer?"  "Col.  Bland, ma'am."  "Please give my compliments to him, and
I shou'd be glad if he would send thee back with a little more manners!"
He reply'd wickedly, and told me I had a little spiteful heart.  But he
was intolerably saucy; said he never met with such ladies.  "Not to let
me kiss you!  You're very ill-natur'd, Sally!"  and,&mdash;putting on the
sauciest face,&mdash;"Sally, if Tacy V*nd*u*n won't have me, will you?"  "No,
really,&mdash;none of her discarded lovers!"  "But, provided I prefer you to
her, will you consent?"  "No, I won't!"  "Very well, madam!"  And, after
saying he would return to-morrow, among a hundred other things, he
elegantly walk'd out of the room.  Soon he came back, took up a volume of
Homer's Illiad, and read to us.  He reads very well, and with judgment.
One remark he made, that I will relate, on these lines,</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>         "While Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,<br>
          Wedg'd in one body, like a flight of cranes."</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>"G-d knows our army don't do so.  I wish they did."  He laugh'd, and went
away.</p>

<p>Four o'clock, afternoon.&mdash;Major Clough, Captain Swan, and Mr. Moore, a
Lieutenant of horse, din'd with Dandridge.  The latter, after dinner,
came in to bid us adieu.  He sat down, and was rather saucy.  I look'd
very grave.  "Miss Betsy, you have a very ill-natur'd sister.  Observe
how cross she looks!"  He pray'd we might part friends, and offer'd his
hand.  I gave him mine, which he kiss'd in a very gallant manner; and so,
with a truly affectionate leave, he walk'd to the parlour door; "God
Almighty bless you, ladies;" bow'd, went into the road, mounted a very
fine horse, and rode away: leaving Watts and the troop here, to take care
of us, as he said.  "Mr. Watts, Miss Sally, is a very worthy man; but,
poor soul, he is so captivated with you,&mdash;the pain in his breast all
owing to you,&mdash;he was caught by this beauty-spot,"&mdash;tapping my cheek.  He
could not have thought it was meant for an addition, as the size of it
shew'd the contrary.  But he is gone; and I think, as I have escap'd thus
far safe, I am quite a heroine, and need not be fearful of any of the
lords of the creation for the future.</p>

<p>Six o'clock, evening.&mdash;Watts drank tea with us.  A conversible man.  Says
that the Dandridges are one of the genteelest families in
Virginia,&mdash;relations of General Washington's wife.  He appear'd very fond of the
Captain, who has had a liberal education.  Very sensible and brave.  I
sat in the entry all last evening, as did Betsy.  But first let me say,
fifth-day morn we chatted on a variety of subjects; and, amongst others,
he mention'd the cruelty of the Britons, which, I agreed, were very
great.  He said he would retaliate whenever he had an opportunity.  I
strenuously opposed such a procedure, observing that it would be erring
in the same way, and, tho' they might deserve it, yet it would be much
nobler to treat them with lenity.  Remember the lines of Pope,</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<p>                   "That mercy I to others show,<br>
                    That mercy show to me."</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>"I perfectly remember them.  Your sentiments are noble; but we must
retaliate sometimes."</p>

<p>A horseman deliver'd this message:&mdash;"Let the troop lie on their arms, and
be ready to march at a moment's warning."  He immediately gave these
orders to the sargeant.  Every soldier was in motion.  I was a good deal
frighten'd, and ask'd Watts the reason.  He fancy'd the British were in
motion, tho' he had not receiv'd such intelligence.  "What will thee do
if they come here?"  "Defend the house as long as I can, ma'am."  I was
shock'd.  "Bless my heart!  What will become of us?"  "You may be very
safe.  The house is an excellent house to defend: only do you be still.
If the British vanquish us, down on your knees, and cry, 'Bless the
King!'  If we conquer them, why, you know you are safe."  This added to
my fright.  I called my dear mamma, who was much indispos'd.  Dadda was
gone to Lancaster.  Mamma ask'd him the same questions, and he gave her
the same answers.  I was in a fearful taking, and said if I thought such
a thing would happen I would set off, though 9 o'clock, and walk to uncle
Foulke's.  "No!  don't go to-night, Miss Sally!  I will take you there
to-morrow.  Don't be uneasy.  This is nothing.  I often go to bed with my
boots on upon some alarms."  "But will thee take off thy boots to-night?"
"Yes, I will, indeed."  "Is thee really in earnest about defending the
house?"  "No, madam; for, believe me, if I hear the enemy is in motion, I
will immediately depart, bag and baggage."</p>

<p>This dispell'd my fears, and, after wishing me a good night, he retir'd
to his chamber.  Imagine my consternation, when our girl came running in
and said the lane was fill'd with light horse!  I flew to the side-door.
It was true!  My joy was great when I heard Major Clough ask if this was
Capt. Dandridge's quarters.  I answer'd in the affirmative.  He rode
round to the other door.  Watts, though gone to bed, was call'd.  He
chatted apart to the Major a while, then went off towards Skippac road,
follow'd by a large party of horse and waggons.  My fears were all
renew'd; and, as if we were to be in perpetual alarms, by came another
party, much larger, in dark clothes.  These we all thought were British.
They halted.  All as still as death.  The officer rode up to the door.
"Does Mr. Foulke live here?"  "Yes," said somebody.  "Is there not a
family from town here,&mdash;Mr. Wister's?"  I recollected the voice, and
said,</p>

<p>"Captain Stodard, I presume?"  "Yes, madam.  Are you Mr. Wister's wife?"
"No: his daughter."</p>

<p>"Is your papa at home?"  "No," I reply'd, but invited him in to see
mamma.  He agreed; dismounted, as did many other officers; but he alone
came into our parlour.  Watts follow'd to bid us adieu.  They sat a few
minutes; told us that two of their men had deserted, and when that was
the case they generally moved their quarters.  Watts told him how I was
frighten'd.  He said I paid but a poor compliment to their cavalry!  I
only smil'd.  The alarm had partly deprived me of the power of speech!</p>

<p>They sat about fifteen minutes, then rose, and, after the politest
adieus, departed.  All the horse follow'd, about one hundred and fifty.
I never seen more regularity observ'd, or so undisturb'd a silence kept
up when so large a number of people were together.  Not a voice was
heard, except that of the officer who gave the word of command.  The moon
at intervals broke thro' the heavy black clouds.  No noise was perceiv'd,
save that which the horses made as they trotted o'er the wooden bridge
across the race.  Echo a while gave us back the sound.  At last, nothing
was left but the remembrance of them.  The family all retir'd to their
respective chambers and enjoy'd a calm repose.</p>

<p>This Captain Stodard is from New England, and belongs to Col. Sheldon's
regiment of dragoons.  He made an acquaintance with my father at
Germantown, whilst our army was at that place, and had been here once
before.  He is clever and gentlemanly.</p>

<p>
Fifth day, June 4th, 2 o'clock.&mdash;Oh, gracious!  how warm is this day!
But, warm as it is, I must make a small alteration in my dress.  I do not
make an elegant figure, tho': I do not expect to see the face of a
stranger to-day.</p>

<p>
Sixth day, June 5th, morn, 11 o'clock.&mdash;Last night we were a little
alarm'd.  I was awaken'd about 12 with somebody's opening the chamber
door.  I observ'd cousin Prissa talking to mamma.  I ask'd what was the
matter.  "Only a party of light-horse."  "Are they Americans?"  I quickly
said.  She answer'd in the affirmative, (which dispell'd my fears,) and
told me that Major Jameson commanded, and that Capts. Call and Nixon were
with him.  With that intelligence she left us.  I resolv'd in my mind
whether or not Jameson would renew his acquaintance; but Morpheus buried
all my ideas, and this morn I rose by, or near, seven, dress'd in my
light chintz, which is made gown-fashion, kenting handkerchief, and linen
apron.  Sufficiently smart for a country girl, Sally!  Don't call me a
country girl, Debby Norris!  Please to observe that I pride myself on
being a Philadelphian, and that a residence of 20 months has not at all
diminished the love I have for that place; and as soon as one capital
alteration takes place, (which is very much talk'd of at present,) I
expect to return to it with a double pleasure.</p>

<p>Dress'd as above, down I came, and went down to our kitchen, which is a
small distance from the house.  As I came back, I seen Jameson at the
window.  He met me in the entry, bow'd:&mdash;"How do you do, Miss Sally?"
After the compliments usual on such occasions had pass'd, I invited him
into our parlour.  He follow'd me in.  We chatted very sociably.  I
inquir'd for P. F.  He said he had seen her last first-day; that she was
well.  Her mamma had gone to Lancaster to visit her daughter Wharton,
who, as I suppose, you have heard, has lost her husband.</p>

<p>I ask'd him whether Dandridge was on this side the Delaware.  He said,
"Yes."  I wanted sadly to hear his opinion, but he said not a word.  The
conversation turn'd upon the British leaving Philadelphia.  He firmly
believ'd they were going.  I sincerely wish'd it might be true, but was
afraid to flatter myself.  I had heard it so often that I was quite
faithless, and express'd my approbation of Pope's 12th beatitude,
"Blessed are they that expect nothing; for they shall not be
disappointed."  He smil'd, and assur'd me they were going away.</p>

<p>He was summon'd to breakfast.  I ask'd him to stay with us.  He declin'd
the invitation with politeness, adding that he was in a hurry,-oblig'd to
go to camp as soon as he could.  He bow'd, "Your servant, ladies," and
withdrew immediately.  After breakfast they set off for Valley Forge,
where Gen'l Washington's army still are.</p>

<p>I am more pleas'd with Major Jameson than I was at first.  He is sensible
and agreeable,&mdash;a manly person, and a very good countenance.  We girls
differ about him.  Prissa and I admire him, whilst Liddy and Betsy will
not allow him a spark of beauty.  Aunt's family are charm'd with his
behaviour,&mdash;so polite, so unassuming.  When he disturb'd them last night,
he made a hundred apologies,&mdash;was so sorry to call them up,&mdash;'twas real
necessity oblig'd him.  I can't help remarking the contrast between him
and Dandridge.  The former appears to be rather grave than gay,&mdash;no vain,
assuming airs.  The latter calls for the genius of a Hogarth to
characterize him.  He is possess'd of a good understanding, a very
liberal education, gay and volatile to excess: he is an Indian, a
gentleman, grave and sad, in the same hour.  But what signifies?  I can't
give thee a true idea of him; but he assumes at pleasure a behaviour the
most courtly, the most elegant of any thing I ever seen.  He is very
entertaining company, and very vain of his personal beauties; yet
nevertheless his character is exceptionable.</p>

<p>Sixth day, noon and evening.&mdash;Nothing material occurr'd.</p>

<p>Seventh day night.&mdash;A dull morn.  In the afternoon, Liddy, Betsy, R. H.,
and self went to one of our neighbours to eat strawberries.  Got a few;
return'd home; drank tea; no beaus.  Adieu.</p>

<p>First day evening.  Heigh-ho!  Debby, there's a little meaning in that
exclamation, ain't there?  To me it conveys much.  I have been looking
what the Dictionary says.  It denotes uneasiness of mind.  I don't know
that my mind is particularly uneasy just now.</p>

<p>The occurrences of the day come now.  I left my chamber between eight and
nine, breakfasted, went up to dress, put on a new purple and white
striped Persian, white petticoat, muslin apron, gauze cap and
handkerchief.  Thus array'd, Miss Norris, I ask your opinion.  Thy
partiality for thy friend will bid thee say I made a tolerable
appearance!  Not so, my dear.  I was this identical Sally Wister, with
all her whims and follies; and they have gain'd so great an ascendancy
over my prudence, that I fear it will be a hard matter to divest myself
of them.  But I will hope for a reformation.</p>

<p>Cousin H. M. came about nine, and spent the day with us.  After we had
din'd, two dragoons rode up to the door,&mdash;one a waiting-man of
Dandridge's, the faithful Jonathan.  They are quarter'd a few miles from
us.  The junior sisters, Liddy and Betsy, join'd by me, ventur'd to send
our compliments to the Captain and Watts.  Prissa insists that it is
vastly indelicate, and that she has done with us.  Hey-day!  What prudish
notions are those, Priscilla?  I banish prudery.  Suppose we had sent our
love to him,&mdash;where had been the impropriety? for really he had a person
that was love-inspiring,&mdash;tho' I escap'd, and may say, Io triumphe.  I
answer not for the other girls, but am apt to conclude that Cupid shot
his arrows, and that may-be they had effect.  A fine evening this.  If
wishes could avail, I would be in your garden with S. J., R. F., and
thyself.  Thee has no objection to some of our North Wales swains,&mdash;not
the beau inhabitants, but some of the transitory ones.  But, cruel
reverse! instead of having my wishes accomplish'd, I must confine myself
to the narrow limits of this farm.</p>

<p>Liddy calls: "Sally, will thee walk?"  "Yes."  Perhaps a walk will give a
new turn to my ideas, and present something new to my vacant imagination.</p>

<p>
Second day, third day, fourth day.&mdash;No new occurrences to relate.  Almost
adventureless, except Gen'l Lacy's riding by, and his fierce horse
disdaining to go without showing his airs, in expectation of drawing the
attention of the Mill girls, in order to glad his master's eyes.  Ha! ha!
ha!  One would have imagin'd that vanity had been buried within the
shades of N. Wales.  Lacy is tolerable; but, as ill luck would order it,
I had been busy, and my auburn ringlets were much dishevell'd: therefore
I did not glad his eyes, and cannot set down on the list of honours
receiv'd that of a bow from Brigadier-General Lacy!</p>

<p>
Fifth day night, June 18th.&mdash;Rose at half-past four this morning.  Iron'd
industriously till one o'clock, din'd, went up-stairs, threw myself on
the bed, and fell asleep.  About four, sister H. wak'd me, and said uncle
and J. F.  were down-stairs; so I decorated myself, and went down.  Felt
quite lackadasical.  However, I jump'd about a little, and the stupid fit
went off.  We have had strange reports about the British being about
leaving Philadelphia.  I can't believe it.  Adieu.</p>

<p>Sixth day morn, June 19th.&mdash;We have heard an astonishing piece of news!
The English have entirely left the city!  It is almost impossible!  Stay.
I shall hear further.</p>

<p>Sixth day eve.&mdash;A light horseman has just confirm'd the above
intelligence!  This is charmante!  They encamp'd yesterday.  He (the
horseman) was in Philadl.  It is true!  They have gone!!  Past a doubt.
I can't forbear exclaiming to the girls, "Now are you sure the news is
true?  Now are you sure they have gone?"  "Yes, yes, yes!"  they all cry;
"and may they never, never return!"</p>

<p>Dr. Gould came here to-night.  Our army are about six miles off, on their
march to the jerseys.</p>

<p>Seventh day morn.&mdash;O. F. arriv'd just now, and related as followeth:&mdash;The
army began their march at six this morning by their house.  Our worthy
Gen'l Smallwood breakfasted at uncle Caleb's.  He ask'd how Mr. and Mrs.
Wister and the young ladies were, and sent his respects to us.  Our
brave, our heroic GENERAL WASHINGTON was escorted by fifty of the
Life-Guard, with drawn swords.  Each day he acquires an addition to his
goodness.  We have been very anxious to know how the inhabitants have
far'd.  I understand that General Arnold, who bears a good character, has
the command of the city, and that the soldiers conducted with great
decorum.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>     [Since my writing the above, Gen'l Arnold has forfeited all right to
     a good character, by the shameful desertion of his country's cause,
     joining the British, accepting a command, and plundering and
     distressing the Americans.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smallwood says they had the strictest orders to behave well; and I dare
say they obey'd the order.  I now think of nothing but returning to
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>So I shall now conclude this journal, with humbly hoping that the Great
Disposer of events, who has graciously vouchsaf'd to protect us to this
day through many dangers, will still be pleas'd to continue his
protection.</p>

<h2>          LETTER FROM MARTHA WASHINGTON TO MRS. GENERAL WARREN.</h2>
<br>
<h3>                    NEW YORK, December the 26th, 1789.</h3></center>
<br>
<p>MY DEAR MADAM</p>
<br>
<p>Your very friendly letter of the 27th of last month has afforded me much
more satisfaction than all the formal compliments and empty ceremonies of
mere etiquette could possibly have done.  I am not apt to forget the
feelings that have been inspired by my former society with good
acquaintances, nor to be insensible to their expressions of gratitude to
the President of the United States; for you know me well enough to do me
the justice to believe that I am only fond of what comes from the heart.</p>

<p>Under a conviction that the demonstrations of respect and affection which
have been made to the President originate from that source, I cannot deny
that I have taken some interest and pleasure in them.  The difficulties
which presented themselves to view on his first entering upon the
Presidency seem thus to be in some measure surmounted.  It is owing to
this kindness of our numerous friends in all quarters, that my new and
unwish'd-for situation is not indeed a burden to me.  When I was much
younger, I should, probably, have enjoyed the innocent gaities of life as
much as most of my age; but I had long since placed all the prospects of
my future worldly happiness in the still enjoyments of the fireside at
Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>I little thought, when the war was finished, that any circumstances could
possibly have happened which would call the General into public life
again.  I had anticipated that from this moment we should have been left
to grow old in solitude and tranquility together.  That was, my dear
madam, the first and dearest wish of my heart; but in that I have been
disappointed.  I will not, however, contemplate with too much regret
disappointments that were inevitable.  Though the General's feelings and
my own were perfectly in unison with respect to our predelection for
private life, yet I cannot blame him for having acted according to his
ideas of duty in obeying the voice of his country.  The consciousness of
having attempted to do all the good in his power, and the pleasure of
finding his fellow-citizens so well satisfied with the disinterestedness
of his conduct, will doubtless be some compensation for the great
sacrifices which I know he has made.  Indeed, in his journeys from Mount
Vernon to this place,&mdash;in his late tour through the Eastern States,&mdash;by
every public and every private information which has come to him,&mdash;I am
persuaded that he has experienced nothing to make him repent his having
acted from what he conceived to be alone a sense of indispensable duty.
On the contrary, all his sensibility has been awakened in receiving such
repeated and unequivocal proofs of sincere regard from all his
countrymen.</p>

<p>With respect to myself, I sometimes think the arrangement is not quite as
it ought to have been; that I, who had much rather be at home, should
occupy a place with which a great many younger and gayer women would be
prodigiously pleased.</p>

<p>As my grandchildren and my domestic connections made up a great portion
of the felicity which I looked for in this world, I shall hardly be able
to find any substitute that would indemnify me for the loss of a part of
such endearing society.  I do not say this because I feel dissatisfied
with my present situation.  No.  God forbid! for every body and every
thing conspire to make me as contented as possible in it.  Yet I know too
much of the vanity of human affairs to expect felicity from the splendid
scenes of public life.  I am still determined to be cheerful and to be
happy, in whatever situation I may be; for I have also learned from
experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends upon
our dispositions, and not upon our circumstances.  We carry the seeds of
the one or the other about with us, in our minds, wherever we go.</p>

<p>I have two of my grandchildren with me, who enjoy advantages in point of
education, and who, I trust, by the goodness of Providence, will continue
to be a great blessing to me.  My other two grandchildren are with their
mother in Virginia.</p>

<p>The President's health is quite re-established by his little journey.
Mine is much better than it used to be.  I am sorry to hear that General
Warren has been ill: hope, before this time, that he may be entirely
recovered.  We should rejoice to see you both.  To both I wish the best
of Heaven's blessings, and am,</p>

<p>My dear madam,</p>
<br>
<p>With esteem and regard,</p>
<br>
<p>Your friend and hble sert,</p>
<br>
<p>M. WASHINGTON.</p>
<br>
<p>
Mrs. WARREN.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
